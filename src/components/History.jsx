          The Idomas are a people that primarily inhabit the lower western areas of Benue State, 
          Nigeria, and some of them can be found in Taraba State, Cross River State, Enugu State, Kogi 
          State and Nasarawa State in Nigeria.[1] The Idoma language is classified in the Akweya 
          subgroup of the Idomoid languages of the Volta–Niger family, which include Igede, Alago, 
          Agatu, Etulo, Ete, Akweya (Akpa) and Yala languages of Benue, Nasarawa, Kogi, Enugu, and 
          Northern Cross River states. The Akweya subgroup is closely related to the Yatye-Akpa 
          subgroup. The bulk of the territory is inland, south of river Benue, some seventy-two 
          kilometres east of its confluence with River Niger.



          The Idoma tribe are known to be 'warriors' and 'hunters' of class, but hospitable and 
          peaceloving. The greater part of Idoma land remained largely unknown to the West until the 
          1920s, leaving much of the colourful traditional culture of the Idoma intact. The population of 
          the Idomas is estimated to be about 3.5 million. The Idoma people have a traditional ruler 
          called the Och'Idoma who is the head of the Idoma Area Traditional Council. This was 
          introduced by the British. Each community has its own traditional chief such as the former 
          Ad'Ogbadibo of Orokam, Late Chief D.E Enenche. The Palace of the Och'Idoma is located at 
          Otukpo, Benue State. The present Och'Idoma, HRM, Elaigwu Odogbo John, the 5th 
          Och'Idoma of the Idoma People was installed on the 30th of June,[2][3] 2022 following the 
          passing of his Predecessor HRH Agabaidu Elias Ikoyi Obekpa who ruled from 1996 to October 
          2021.[4][5] Past Och'Idomas also include: HRH, Agabaidu Edwin Ogbu, who reigned from 
          1996 to 1997, HRH, Abraham Ajene Okpabi of Igede descent who ruled from 1960 to 1995 and 
          HRH, Agabaidu Ogiri Oko whose reign took place between 1948 and 1959.



          The history of the Idoma people precedes the history of Benue State (created 1976) and the 
          history of the Republic of Nigeria (created 1960). Oral tradition and dance is the primary 
          method through which history has been passed in Idomaland and is considered a central 
          cultural institution. From a young age, Idoma children usually learn from their elder's stories of 
          old and were brought up around extended families, which make multiple historical resources 
          available. When prompted, Idomas generally will proudly tell you where they are from, and it's 
          not uncommon for Idoma to be able to recite at least four generations of their progenitors. 
          Historically, being unable to answer the emblematic question “Who is your father?” 
          disqualified one from important roles and titles in Idomaland. Quite naturally, a number of 
          villages trace origins to single ancestors and further, several Idoma groups trace their 
          heritage to one common ancestor, considered the “father” of the different groups. 
          According to traditional history, Iduh, the father of the Idoma had several children who each 
          established different areas. Hence the expression: “Iduh the father of Idoma.” “Iduh the 
          father of Idoma Iduh who begot all the Idoma He also begot the following children: 
          Ananawoogeno who begot the children of Igwumale; Olinaogwu who begot the people of 
          Ugboju; Idum who begot the people of Adoka; Agabi who begot the people of Otukpo; Eje 
          who begot the people of Oglewu; Ebeibi who begot the people of Umogidi in Adoka, Edeh 
          who begot the people of Edumoga and Ode who begot the people of Yala ” While there may 
          be some truth to the above, the Idoma cannot be said to have a unitary origin. Many Idoma 
          groups and village subsets have their own histories complete with stories about how their 
          people arrived at their current location. The Otukpa people descended from three 
          ancestors: Owuno, Ameh-Ochagbaha and Oodo. The first two were brothers who migrated 
          from Idah in Igalaland while Oodo migrated from Igbo land. As one can imagine, the ever￾changing movement of people through time makes it difficult to study Idoma history. There 
          are some Idomas who are originally Igbos and heavily intermarried with the Northern fringes 
          of Igboland.



          Scholars have combined oral history with genealogical data and analysis of kinship totems to 
          trace the roots of the Idoma people as a whole. One notable Idoma scholar E.O. Erim cites 
          genealogical data, collected from most modern groups in Idoma suggesting that they derive 
          from several ethnic groups, each with a different historical origin. Furthermore, the available 
          genealogies indicate the existence of diverse ethnic groups who descended from ancestors 
          other than Idu. In several of these cases, the claim of common descent is backed by both 
          extensive genealogical connections and possession of common kinship totems. Erim 
          contends that while Idu was certainly a migration leader—he was not the “father” of the 
          Idoma in the sense implied in the above traditions. These two considerations make it difficult 
          to simply accept the view that every group in Idomaland is descended from Idu.[6]



          Many Idoma kindred claims an ancestral homeland called Apa, north-east of present-day 
          Idomaland due to pressures of Northern invaders as recently as 300 years ago. The historical 
          Apa was part of the ancient Kwararafa Kingdom (Okolofa Kingdom), a confederacy of several 
          peoples. Informants in other ethnic groups have corroborated the existence of this kingdom, 
          chiefly the Jukun who also believe they once ruled a confederacy called Kwararafa. In the 
          Hausa book Kano Chronicle it is mentioned that Zaria, under Queen Amina conquered all 
          towns as far as Kwarafara in the 15th century. At present, there is a Local Government Area in 
          Benue State called Apa and is said to be the home of those who made the first migration from 
          the historical kingdom. For many Idoma nationalists today, the name Apa elicits sentiments 
          of past glory, and some in the political sphere have gone as far as suggesting it should 
          become the name of a new Idoma state.
